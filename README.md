# Capstone_2

This project uses data from ebird to create maps of bird distributions and a predictive algorithm that identifies a bird's species based on color, size, and location. 

For an overview, refer to the Capstone 2 Documentation file

To review the actual code, refer to they jupyter notebooks:
Ebird_data_importing_and_basic_EDA - imports the data from ebird and does some basic processing
Ebird_EDA - uses kepler to map out the bird sightings on a map of California
Birds_ML_preprocessing - adds dummy variables and gets the data ready for ML analysis
Birds_of_Prey_ML - uses the ebird data as inputs into some ML classifiers to classify by species
